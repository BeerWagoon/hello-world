# hello-world

Hi, I'm Brian. I am here to learn more about coding in hopes to eventually make the transition toward the development side of IT rather than the administration side. I have dabbled in programming in the past and have taken a few electives, mostly working with higher level languages such as JavaScript. This time around I plan to concentrate on Java programming.
